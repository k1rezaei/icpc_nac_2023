For a single game, if you can reach states $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_p$ from $i$, then $G(i) = \text{mex} \{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_p \}$

For multiple independent games, the Grundy number is the XOR of the numbers of the games

If constraints are big:

- Strategy stealing

- Calculate small values and look for pattern
